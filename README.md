Robot: A Context-Aware Terminal Assistant1. AbstractRobot is a command-line tool that enhances your terminal with an integrated, context-aware AI assistant. By activating a Robot session, the tool transparently records your commands and their outputs, building a complete context of your work. At any point, you can invoke robot with a natural language question to get intelligent insights, summaries, or explanations based on the activity in your current session. It's designed to feel like a native feature of your shell, providing the power of a large language model without interrupting your workflow.2. The VisionThe goal of Robot is to seamlessly integrate an intelligent assistant into the command-line environment. The terminal is a developer's most powerful tool, but recalling specific commands, deciphering complex outputs, and keeping track of a multi-step process can be challenging.Robot addresses this by creating an "enhanced" terminal session that maintains a memory of your actions. This session history serves as a dynamic context for an LLM, allowing you to ask complex questions that relate to previous commands and their results. This moves beyond simple command-lookup and toward a genuine conversational partner for your development tasks.3. How It WorksThe interaction model is designed to be unobtrusive, similar to activating a Python virtual environment.Core WorkflowActivate a Session: You begin by starting a Robot-aware session. This command launches a new sub-shell where all input and output will be monitored.robot activate
Your terminal prompt will change slightly to indicate that you are in an active Robot session.Work as Usual: Use the terminal as you normally would. Robot works in the background, logging your commands and their results.(robot) $ ls -l

Ask a Question: When you need help or information, use the robot command followed by your question in plain English.(robot) $ robot "Based on the files here, what is the purpose of the shell script?"
Get an Answer: Robot analyzes the recorded session context (the ls and head commands and their output) and provides a relevant answer.> The script 'process.sh' likely processes the 'data.csv' file. The CSV file contains columns named 'id', 'value', and 'timestamp'.
Deactivate the Session: When you're done, you can exit the session and return to your normal shell.(robot) $ exit

4. Technical PlanThis project will be developed in Python, focusing on robust session management and seamless LLM integration.Core Components:Session Management (Pseudo-Terminal):The core of Robot's functionality will rely on Python's pty module. The robot activate command will spawn a new user shell (e.g., /bin/bash or /bin/zsh) as a child process running within a pseudo-terminal.The main Robot process will act as the master of the pty, allowing it to read all output from the shell (stdout) and write all input to it (stdin).Background Logging:During an active session, all I/O passing through the pseudo-terminal will be captured and written to a temporary log file.This log will be a structured record of the entire terminal session, preserving the sequence of commands and their exact outputs, which is crucial for providing accurate context to the LLM.Command-Line Interface (CLI):We will use Typer to build the CLI.The primary commands will be:robot activate: Starts the monitored session.robot <query>: The command used within an active session to ask a question. This command will locate the session log, package it with the query, and send it to the LLM.LLM Integration:The robot <query> command will read the entire content of the current session's log file.This content will be formatted into a prompt for a large language model. The prompt will be engineered to instruct the LLM to act as a terminal assistant and answer the user's query based on the provided session transcript.The response from the LLM will be printed directly to the terminal.5. Project RoadmapThe project will be developed in distinct phases, starting with the most critical functionality.Phase 1: Core Session Management[ ] Implement the robot activate command to successfully launch a sub-shell within a pseudo-terminal using Python's pty module.[ ] Develop the background logging mechanism to capture all session I/O to a temporary file.[ ] Create the basic robot <query> command that reads the log file and the user's query.[ ] Integrate with a foundational LLM API to establish the proof-of-concept pipeline.Phase 2: Refinement and Usability[ ] Improve the prompt engineering to handle long session contexts and provide more accurate answers.[ ] Implement clean session start-up and tear-down, including handling of the session log files.[ ] Add configuration options (e.g., choosing the LLM provider, setting API keys).[ ] Refine the in-session prompt to provide clear feedback to the user.Phase 3: Advanced Features[ ] Explore options for session history, allowing users to ask questions about previous sessions.[ ] Investigate using more efficient or local LLMs to improve privacy and reduce latency.[ ] Add "intent detection" to suggest commands or actions, making Robot a more proactive assistant.Phase 4: Distribution and Community[ ] Package the application for easy installation via PyPI.[ ] Write comprehensive user and developer documentation.[ ] Perform testing across different shells (bash, zsh, fish) and operating systems (Linux, macOS).
